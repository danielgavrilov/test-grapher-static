By summing the annual emissions to a given year we have calculated the cumulative total. \n\nThis is given as the share of global cumulative emissions by dividing each country or region's cumulative emissions by the cumulative world emissions for that given year. \n\nData converted from carbon into carbon dioxide (using conversion factor of 3.67). Data for Australia appears to be negative from 1851-1858; for clarity, these figures have been renormalised to zero.\n\nArchived data is held at the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Centre (CDIAC).
